# My LeetCode Practice Journey

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in Python. It serves as a personal log of my progress and a practical application of data structures and algorithms.

A key aspect of this project is the use of the **Gemini CLI** as a development assistant. It helped with:

*   Initial project scaffolding (`venv`, `.gitignore`).
*   Setting up the `pytest` testing framework.
*   Generating boilerplate code for solution and test files.
*   Providing guidance on conventions and best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Testing:** `pytest`
*   **Assistant:** Gemini CLI
*   **Version Control:** Git

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a clean and organized structure to keep solutions and their corresponding tests separate and easy to find.

```
.
├── solutions/      # Solution files (e.g., p0088_merge_sorted_array.py)
├── tests/          # Test files (e.g., test_p0088_merge_sorted_array.py)
├── venv/           # Python virtual environment
├── .gitignore      # Standard Python gitignore file
├── main.py         # A general-purpose playground file
└── pytest.ini      # Pytest configuration to find modules
```

## ⚙️ My Workflow

1.  **Activate Environment:** `source venv/bin/activate`
2.  **Create Files:** Create a new solution file in `solutions/` and a corresponding test file in `tests/`.
3.  **Implement Solution:** Write the solution code in the `solutions/` file.
4.  **Write Tests:** Add comprehensive test cases to the `tests/` file.
5.  **Verify:** Run the tests using `venv/bin/pytest`.
